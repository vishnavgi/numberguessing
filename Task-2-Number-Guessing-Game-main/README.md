# Task-2-Number-Guessing-Game

This Java program implements a simple number guessing game where the player has to guess a random number generated within a specified range. The game consists of multiple rounds, and in each round, the player has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.

How to Play
Setup

The game will generate a random number within a specified range (default: 1 to 100).
You will have a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number (default: 10 attempts per round).
The game consists of a total of 3 rounds.
Playing a Round

In each round, you will be prompted to guess the number within the given range.
Enter your guess and receive feedback on whether the actual number is greater or smaller than your guess.
Try to guess the number within the given attempts for each round.
Scoring

You earn points based on the number of attempts left after guessing the correct number.
The score for each round is calculated as MAX_ATTEMPTS - attempts_taken.
